    <p>
      We worked hand in hand with the Mariana Tek dev team to develop several required features for a major
      client release. This included an initial scan of the codebase, the addition of several ESLint rules from
      eslint-plugin-ember, and updates of various dependencies. We enforced best practices at every turn, and ensured the
      code looked very consistent, no matter who wrote it.

    <p>
      We did several months of work with Scout,
      starting with updating to the latest versions of
      Ember and Ember CLI, adding Ember Suave, and adhering
      to the new set of ESLint rules.

      We worked extensively on the appointment scheduling
      aspects of the app, creating full screen overlays,
      using Ember Flatpickr, Ember Paper and Ember Power Select,
      to allow a customer or staff member to create or edit an
      appointment.

    <p>
      We first updated the greenlight.guru app to Ember 1.12, fixing deprecations as we went.
      After 1.12 was complete, we undertook the task of migrating a grunt based build to ember-cli.
      We finally updated the app to Ember 1.13 and fixed all the deprecations.

    <h3>Mentrs</h3>

    <p>
      We worked on the Mentrs MVP from the ground up,
      starting with running 'ember new', and adding all the addons,
      ESLint plugins, template lintings, and doing all the initial
      work required to create an Ember app, rooted in the latest Ember standards.

    <p>
      Features we implemented included everything from login and sign up,
      to class creation, and Stripe integration for paying to enroll in classes.
